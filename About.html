            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I have been studying music and performance for as long as I can remember. I play four instruments and I am a classically trained vocalist. In 2019, I spent some time at Purdue Fort Wayne studying Music Therapy, but quickly lost my passion and dropped out. Even though I didn't stick it out at Purdue, music and performance will always be a major part of my life. I'm always keeping an eye out for the next show I can attend. If you're bored of your music right now, give me a follow on Spotify and check out what I'm listening to!</p>

            <h2>Cats!</h2>
            <p>Throughout my life, my family has consistently had 4+ cats. Most of which were strays that showed up on our doorstep and adopted us. We share them all, except for one- Penny. I adopted Penny during my time in college. The shelter in the area was having a sale on cats, $5 per cat, and I had $8 to my name. I wasn't planning on adopting a cat, despite the sale, until I saw her and decided she was worth every <b>Penny</b>. *wink*.</p>
            <p>I couldn't afford to buy her food due to only having $3 left, so I resorted to cooking her eggs. Eventually she started to understand where her food was coming from, and she started joining me in the kitchen as my sous chef. She still demands to smell and taste everything I touch to this day.</p>

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>In between dropping out of college, and June of this year, 2022, I worked at a tapas style wine bar called LouVino. I started as expo and eventually worked my way up to sous chef. The environment was not so great at times and I was practically chained to the place for 3 years, but I learned a lot in the process. Even though I left the industry with a sour taste in my mouth, I still love cooking. It's, in my opinion, one of the best art forms there is. Not only is it a visual art form, it can evoke emotions like comfort, nostalgia, and sappiness all at the same time.</p>
            <p>The industry also taught me many essential leadership skills and made me grow a spine. As gruelling as the work was, I'm thankful I can say I had that experience and will carry the lessons learned with me throughout the rest of my life.</p>

            <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>I took a few classes in High School on web development, and I remember thoroughly enjoying the process. 
                Leaving the restauramt industry shook my confidence pretty hard. I felt like that was going to be the industry for me due to my love for cooking for other people. After talking with my family, they helped give me the boost I needed to try it out! I enjoy the victorious feeling of watching my code run successfully.</p>
